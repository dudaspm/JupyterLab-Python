# # Introduction to Python

# In this section I wanted to introduce a few basic concepts and give an outline of this section. 

# ## Comments in Python

# In Python, we can creat comments in the code itself. Considering we can use markdown langauge (as you see here üòÅ), we won't be using this too much in this notebook. Though, here is an example. 
# 
# Basically, you use the... umm... hashtag? number sign? pound sign? 
# 
# This thing #

# In[4]:


# I am a comment in Python
# Here is 2 + 2
2 + 2
# As you can see, these are not "computed" using Python. 
# We are just comments for the person looking at this.
# Or... you!


# ## Print Function

# We will being using...
# 
# ```python
# print()
# ```
# 
# ...several times in this notebook. 
# 
# Basically, it is a function to print out strings, variables, numbers, functions, etc. 
# 
# Let's use the classic example.

# In[7]:


print( "hello, world!" )


# OR

# In[8]:


print("hello, world!")


# ## Help Function

# The...
# 
# ```python
# help()
# ```
# 
# ... function is exactly what it is. It is a function to üåü help üåü you understand the basic usage of another function. 

# In[9]:


help(print)
