# # Comparison Operators

# We need to be able to compare different variables.  We will be working on:
# * Are these things the same?
# * Are these things not the same?
# * How do these things compare?
# 
# We can compare any data type, and our output will be a boolean (True or False).  The other things we will cover are:
# * Comparing different data types
# * Making multiple comparisons at once
# 
# Comparison operators are important on their own (how do these things compare?) and are also useful for sorting and switching (see the next notebook.) 

# ## Are these things the same?

# ### Numeric Comparisons
# We have already initiated variables by setting something equal to something else - let's do that here by setting kitten üêà equal to 10 and then setting dog üêï equal to kitten üêà. Finally, üêù bee will be equal to 11. 
# 
# So...
# 
# üêà = 10
# 
# üêï = üêà
# 
# üêù = 11

# In[1]:


kitten = 10
dog = kitten
bee = 11 

print( "kitten =", kitten, "; dog =", dog, "; bee = ", bee )


# The first comparison operator is '==' which tests to see if two variables are equal. 

# In[2]:


print( "kitten =", kitten, "; dog =", dog, "; bee = ", bee )

print( "Is kitten equal to dog?")
print( kitten == dog )

print( "Is kitten equal to bee?")
print( kitten == bee )


# This tells us that kitten is equal to dog, because it returns *True* and kitten is not equal to bee, as that returns *False*.

# ### Character Comparisons
# We can also do comparisons with other variable types.  Here's an example with strings instead of integers.
# 
# Let's think about some foods, how about:
# 
# - food1 = üçé
# - food2 = üç™
# - food3 = üçé

# In[3]:


food1 = 'apple'
food2 = 'cookie'
food3 = 'apple' 
print( "food1=", food1,"; food2 =", food2,"; food3 = ", food3 )

print( "Is food1 equal to food2?")
print( food1 == food2 )

print( "Is food1 equal to food3?")
print( food1 == food3 )


# ## Are these things different?

# ### Logical... NOT!
# We can also test to see if two values are not equal using the '!=' operator.

# In[4]:


print( "food1=", food1,"; food2 =", food2,"; food3 = ", food3 )

print( "Is food1 not equal to food2?")
print( food1 != food2 )

print( "Is food1 not equal to food3?")
print( food1 != food3 )


# This gives us the opposite of what we had before.  
# 
# So, what did we learn?
# 
# üçé == üçé = *True*
# 
# üçé != üç™ = *True*

# ## How do these things compare?

# ### Math Comparisons 101
# We can also compare the magnitude of values using '<', '<=', '>'and '>=', which will return 'True' if the condition is being met.

# In[5]:


print( "kitten =", kitten, "; dog =", dog, "; bee = ", bee )


# In[6]:


print( "Is kitten less than dog?")
print( kitten < dog )

print( "Is kitten less than or equal to dog?")
print( kitten <= dog )

print( "Is kitten greater than or equal to dog?")
print( kitten >= dog )

print( "Is kitten greater than dog?")
print( kitten > dog )


# ```{warning}
# We do have to watch out for our types. Characters and numerics are **NOT** the same.
# ```
# 

# In[7]:


aStr = '10'
aFlt = 10.0
print( "aVar=", aVar, "; aStr =", aStr, "; aFlt =", aFlt  )

# Is aVar equal to aStr?
print( "\n#-# Is aVar equal to aStr?")
print( aVar == aStr )
print( "aVar type is ", type( aVar ), "; and aStr type is ", type( aStr ) )

# Is aVar equal to aFlt?
print( "\n#-# Is aVar equal to aFlt?")
print( aVar == aFlt)


# We can compare integers and floats (!) but not other disparate data types.
# 
# If you let python take care of your data-types, be warned that they could be different from what you think they are!

# ## Toy (Car) Problem
# 
# To start thinking of these concepts from a logical perspective, let's create a toy (car) problem. Here are a bunch of either toy cars with various colors and costs.  Here is how they labeled.
# 
# auto:
# - car
# - truck
# 
# color:
# - red
# - blue
# - yellow
# - white
# - black
# 
# cost:
# - 1 <= cost <= 5

# ## Multiple Comparisons

# We can make multiple comparisons at once by stringing the statements
# * and
# * not
# * or
# 
# together. 
# 
# The individual testable (true/false) components need to be broken apart. For example,
# * If the V CATA bus is coming around the corner, then I need to run towards the bus stop
# 
# requires several things for it to be true, and to require running.  We can break these things out with:
# * If there is a vehicle coming around the corner AND that vehicle is a CATA bus AND that CATA bus is a V, then I need to run towards the bus stop
# 
# We will only run towards the bus stop if all of the statements are true

# ### AND

# The and operator will return True if all of the conditions are met

# In[16]:


print( "aVar=", aVar, "; bVar =", bVar, "; cVar = ", cVar )

# Is aVar equal to 10?
print( "\n#-# Is aVar equal to 10?")

# Is aVar equal to bVar?
print( "\n#-# Is aVar equal to bVar?" )
print( aVar == bVar )

# Is aVar equal to cVar?
print( "\n#-# Is aVar equal to cVar?" )
print( aVar == cVar )

# Is aVar equal to 10 AND aVar equal to bVar?
print ( "\n#-# Is aVar equal to 10 AND aVar equal to bVar?")
print( (aVar == 10) and (aVar == bVar) )

# Is aVar equal to 10 AND aVar equal to cVar?
print ( "\n#-# Is aVar equal to 10 AND aVar equal to cVar?")
print( (aVar == 10) and (aVar == cVar) )

# In[17]:


print( (1 < 2) and (1 < 3) and (1 < 4) and (1 < 5) and (1 < 6) and (1 < 7) and (1 < 8) )


# ### OR

# If we want 'True' for either of the conditions to be met, we can use the 'or' operator.

# In[18]:


print( "aVar=", aVar, "; bVar =", bVar, "; cVar = ", cVar )

# Is aVar equal to 10?

# Is aVar equal to 10 OR aVar equal to bVar?
print ( "\n#-# Is aVar equal to 10 OR aVar equal to bVar?")
print( (aVar == 10) or (aVar == bVar) )

# Is aVar equal to 10 OR aVar equal to cVar?
print ( "\n#-# Is aVar equal to 10 or aVar equal to cVar?")

# Is aVar equal to 11 OR aVar equal to cVar?
print ( "\n#-# Is aVar equal to 11 or aVar equal to cVar?")
print( (aVar == 11) or (aVar == cVar) )


# ### Not

# We can add a not to change the meaning of the and/or operators

# In[19]:


print( "aVar=", aVar, "; bVar =", bVar )

# Is aVar equal to 10?
print( "\n#-# Is aVar equal to 10?")
print( aVar == 10 )
